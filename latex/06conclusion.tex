\chapter{Conclusion and future work}

We have presented the Metropolis Light Transport algorithm, a Monte Carlo ray tracing method for unbiased rendering, used primarily for scenes with complicated lightning. We've also shown the various methods that improved on it over the years. A library for interactive visualisation was presented, with methods for general visualisation of light paths, and also methods specifically designed with MLT in mind. A simple demo program followed, visualising data generated by Mitsuba renderer. We hope that the library will be useful in the future, either in development of a new path tracer, or an improvement of an old one, or simply for educational purposes. Possible improvements include more user-friendly interface, or additional filtering methods.
